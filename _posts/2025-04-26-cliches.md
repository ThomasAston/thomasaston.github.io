This month, I launched my newsletter, [xGuff](https://xguff.substack.com/), which is a place for me to share some sports data projects which don't serve much purpose other than to mildly amuse myself.

In the first article I developed a dataset of transcripts for Premier League manager's press conferences, then performed approximate string matching to find instances of some of football's favourite cliches, like "one game at a time" in the transcripts. The aim was to see how often these phrases are used, who uses them most, and whether they correlate at all with actual league position.
