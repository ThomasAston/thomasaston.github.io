I've wanted to try building an interactive sports data visualisation platform for a while now, so when I found out about the [Chelsea FC Performance Insights Vizathon](https://chelsea-fc-performance-insights.github.io/Competition/#challenge) it seemed like the perfect time to learn something new.

For my entry, I decided to build the dashboard in Python (primarily with the [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) package). The platform is mostly built around time-series visualisations using time adjustment sliders and a custom gradient bar chart function I developed, but there are some other fun data visualisations in there like bubble plots, stacked areas, radars, heatmaps and an injury body map. 

I would have liked to incorporate some predictive modelling into the app and tidied up the layout a little bit more, but only finding out about the competition 6 days before the deadline meant I ran out of time. Overall the entry is far from perfect, but as a first attempt at working with Dash I'm really happy with what I was able to produce in such a short time.  

I've embedded the app below to interact with, and it can also be found online [here](https://ta-cfc-vizathon.onrender.com/), but being hosted on the free version of render means that it can be a bit slow/unresponsive.

The source code can also be [found on my GitHub](https://github.com/ThomasAston/CFC-Vizathon/tree/main). Enjoy!
