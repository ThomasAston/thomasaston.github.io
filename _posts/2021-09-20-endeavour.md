Throughout the third and fourth year of my undergraduate, I was involved with the University of Edinburgh's student rocketry team: endeavour.

I was involved in the design and manufacture of the Darwin II supersonic sounding rocket, designed to reach an apogee of 9km. Watch the videos below to see some of the rocket's design in more detail. and [check out the endeavour website](https://www.endeavourockets.com/projects/darwin) to find out more.
