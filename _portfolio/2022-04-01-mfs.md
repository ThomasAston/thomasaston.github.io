My final year project for my MEng involved developing a Python implementation of the meshless numerical method, the Method of Finite Spheres. 

You can find my dissertation outlining this work [here](https://thomasaston.github.io/assets/images/mfs/MEng_TA.pdf), and the accompanying code [here](https://github.com/ThomasAston/PyMFS).
