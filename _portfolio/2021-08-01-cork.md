During the second semester of the fourth year of my MEng, I undertook an 8-month research placement with the Lightweight Structures Dynamics Group at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

Throughout this placement my work was focused on the characterisation of agglomerated cork compounds subjected to high strain rate loading conditions. 

The video below illustrates the performance of the simple tracking algorithm developed to track the ends of the bars in a modified direct impact Hopkinson bar experiment that was performed to extract the stress-strain behaviour of various cork compounds at high strain rates.

The data extracted using the above tracking algorithm was then used to develop constitutive models for the cork compounds. THe videos below provide a qualitative demonstration of the performance of these models compared directly with high-speed experimental video.
