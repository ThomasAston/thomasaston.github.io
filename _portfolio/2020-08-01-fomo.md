During the summer between my third and fourth year of my undergraduate, I completed a summer scholarship with the University of Edinburgh School of Engineering. 

In collaboration with an industry company, I developed a set of numerical models for evaluating the effectiveness of foam and airbag equestrian protective vests.

Using LS-Dyna, constitutive models for the materials used in the vests were validated against the drop weight tests outlined in [EN 13158](https://www.satra.com/ppe/EN13158.php).

Representative models of the protective gear were equipped to the Hybrid III dummy model.

Scenarios replicating impacts with a fence post and between horse and ground were modelled for both vest types in order to examine their effectiveness in reducing the forces experienced by the rib cage.
