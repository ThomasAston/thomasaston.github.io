During the summer between the third and fourth year of my undergraduate, I completed a summer scholarship with the University of Edinburgh School of Engineering. 

In collaboration with an industry company, I developed a set of numerical models for evaluating the effectiveness of equestrian protective vests.

Material models for the foams used in the vests were validated against the drop weight test results
