# About Me

Hello! I’m [Your Name], a PhD researcher at the University of Edinburgh, where I focus on using numerical modeling and artificial intelligence to explore head impact biomechanics in sports. My work aims to improve the understanding of head injuries and contribute to safer sports practices.

With a background in [Your Undergraduate/Master's Degree or Field], I have developed strong expertise in biomechanics, machine learning, and computational simulations. I’m passionate about leveraging technology to address real-world challenges, especially those related to health and safety in athletic environments.

## My Research Interests
- Numerical modeling of dynamic systems
- Artificial intelligence in biomechanics
- Sports injury prevention
- Finite element analysis of head impacts

## Skills and Expertise
- Programming: Python, MATLAB, C++
- Machine Learning: Neural networks, data analysis
- Simulation Tools: LS-DYNA, ABAQUS
- Research Methods: Experimental design, statistical analysis

## Outside of Research
When I’m not immersed in my work, I enjoy [your hobbies or interests, e.g., playing sports, exploring new technologies, or woodworking]. I’m also committed to mentoring and engaging in collaborative projects to promote knowledge-sharing in my field.
