Hello! I’m Thomas, a PhD researcher at the University of Edinburgh, where I focus on using numerical modeling and artificial intelligence to explore head impact biomechanics in sports. My work aims to improve the understanding of head injuries and contribute to safer sports practices.

Following my MEng in Mechanical Engineering, I have developed strong skills in biomechanics, machine learning, and computational simulations. I’m passionate about leveraging engineering technologies to address real-world challenges, especially those related to health and safety in contact sports.

## My Research Interests
- Numerical modeling of dynamic systems
- Artificial intelligence in biomechanics
- Sports injury prevention
- Finite element analysis of head impacts

## Skills and Expertise
- Programming: Python, MATLAB
- Machine Learning: Neural networks, data analysis
- Simulation Tools: LS-DYNA, ABAQUS
- Research Methods: Experimental design, statistical analysis

## Outside of Research
When I’m not working, I enjoy long distance running, playing football, cooking, and wild camping.
